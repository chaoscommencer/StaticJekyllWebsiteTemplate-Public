# gem install bundler

# bundle init

# modifications are made to this Gemfile):
# bundle config set path 'vendor/bundle'
# bundle install

# Alternatively, if Jekyll is already installed, initialize a new Jekyll
# repository as follows:
#
# jekyll new <directory_name>
#
# This will auto-generate a Gemfile with default versions of several other
# common project files.

# Declare the Rubygems source containing the gems listed in the Gemfile.

  # 1. Add the ruby platform to the bundle to support the ruby version of
  # EventMachine:
  # bundle lock --add-platform ruby
  # 2. Uninstall the existing x64-mingw32 build of EventMachine:
  # gem uninstall eventmachine # May require: --force

  # gem install eventmachine --platform ruby
  # gem 'eventmachine', :platforms => :ruby # Version 1.2.7
